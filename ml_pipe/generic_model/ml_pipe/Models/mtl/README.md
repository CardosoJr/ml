# Multi-task Learning Models 

In this dir are some MTL architecture in which we are testing inside our framework. 

Some of the implementations are: 
 * **Naive**: simple hard parameter sharing with loss function with weights 
 * **Meta MTL**: meta learning to predict classes for the aux task (http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8445-self-supervised-generalisation-with-meta-auxiliary-learning.pdf)
 * **Weighted**: learning loss function weights for each task 
 * **Multi Obj**: dealing with multi task as multibojective problem
