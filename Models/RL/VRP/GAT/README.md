# Graph Attention Network 

The idea here is to test the model based on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03282 
(A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Using Dynamic Attention Model for Vehicle Routing Problems)

The code is based on the official implementation found at https://github.com/d-eremeev/ADM-VRP. After that, I'm adapting 
it to add more complexity to the problem such as adding time windows constraints.
