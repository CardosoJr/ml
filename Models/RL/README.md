# Deep Reinforcement Learning 

Some experiments using Deep RL to solve: 
* Dynamic Pricing (online / offline RL) 
* Operations Research problems (using imitation learning and Deep RL) 

Another approach to OR problems would be augment metaheuristics with ML. ML models could benefit the optimization algorithm
by estimating obj. functions, predict operations probabilities, surrogate for expensive calculations and many others.
